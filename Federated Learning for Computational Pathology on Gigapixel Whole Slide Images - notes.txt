Federated Learning for Computational Pathology on Gigapixel Whole Slide Images
Ming Y. Lu, et. al.

- multiple instance learning
- 1000s of WSIs
- breast cancer and renal cell carcionoma - slide level labels
- attention based pooling - weakly supervised - survival prediction
- master server approach
- add noise for privacy
